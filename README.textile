h1.SQWIDGET COMPRESSOR
h2. A web asset optimization tool


h3. Workflow:
 
# Compresses gif,png,and jpeg image assets.
# Concatenates and minifies css and javascript files. 
# Embeds inline image assets linked from the stylesheet into data:uris or mhtml(ie < v8).


h3. Status: 

This code is in Pre-pre-alpha state.. At the moment it barely does point 1 and 2 and it does not have yet 
user interface whatsoever. 

h3. Requirements:

 (assuming that you are running Ubuntu Linux  )

* @apt-get install gifsicle@
* @apt-get install pngcrush@
* @apt-get install libjpeg-progs@

* @apt-get install rubygems@
* @gem install yui-compressor@
* @gem install closure-compiler@
* @gem install rspec@ (testing only) 

h3. Running it:

In order to reproduce the same directory structure that I am currently
using while developing/testing the compressor, downlad Polpo, a Drupal theme 
(this was almost a random, arbitrary choice).

*  @wget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/polpo-6.x-1.1.tar.gz@ 
*  @tar zxvf polpo-6.x-1.1.tar.gz@
*  @mv polpo specs/test_dir@ 
    
then 
  
@ruby run.rb@
  
This just triggers the execution chain. I would not say that at the moment this produces an informative output, 
but I am working on that :)
