h1. Sqwiget Compressor

h2. yet another web asset optimization tool


h3. Workflow
 
# Compresses gif,png,and jpeg image files.
# Concatenates and minifies css and javascript files. 
# Embeds inline image assets linked from the stylesheet into data:uris or mhtml(ie < v8).


h3. Status

This code is in Pre-pre-alpha state.. At the moment it barely does point 1 and 2 and it does not have yet 
user interface whatsoever. 

h3. Requirements

 (assuming that you are running Ubuntu Linux  )

* @apt-get install gifsicle@
* @apt-get install pngcrush@
* @apt-get install libjpeg-progs@

* @apt-get install rubygems@
* @gem install yui-compressor@
* @gem install closure-compiler@
* @gem install rspec@ (testing only) 

h3. Running it

In order to reproduce the same directory structure that I am currently
using while developing/testing the compressor, download Polpo, a Drupal theme 
(this was  a random, arbitrary choice), uncompress it, and place it into spec/test_dir.

*  @wget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/polpo-6.x-1.1.tar.gz@ 
*  @tar zxvf polpo-6.x-1.1.tar.gz@
*  @mv polpo specs/test_dir@ 
    
then: 
  
@ruby run.rb@
 
Actually the run.rb script does not actually modify files, but nonetheless triggers the complete 
execution chain, printing to standard output the commands issued and, in case of javascript and css, 
the compressed output. I reckon that this output is not really readable, but yet it gives a sense of 
what is happening.
