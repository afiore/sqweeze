== Sqweeze 
A command line web asset optimisation tool. 

=== Features

_Sqweeze_ cuts the unnecessary bytes out of your web assets, helping you delivering your web project more fast and efficiently. 
With a little help from a number of well known open source third party tools, _Sqweeze_ does the following:

* Lossless compresses .PNG, .JPEG and .GIF image assets. 
* Compresses and concatenates into single files multiple Stylesheets and Javascript files.
* Embeds the compressed assets referenced into the stylesheet, using using {Data-uris}[https://developer.mozilla.org/En/The_data_URL_scheme] (for proper browsers and IE8) and {MHTML}[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML] (for IE6-7). 
* Finally, it provides some basic functionality for linking the compressed Javascript and CSS just created to the main HTML document, 
  and removing automatically the links pointing to the old uncompressed ones.  

=== Installing it

Sqweeze relies on a few command-line image compression tools, namely Pngcrush, Jpegtrain, and Gifsicle, which have to be installed first. 
On an Ubuntu box, you can install these by running a single command line
 
  sudo apt-get install pngcrush gifsicle libjpeg-progs  

(This assumes you have ruby, ruby1.8-dev, and gem installed).

Mac OSX users can install the first two as Macports packages. The third (part of libjpeg) instead, has to be 
{compiled manually}[http://www.phpied.com/installing-jpegtran-mac-unix-linux]. 

Once installed these, you can install _Sqweeze_ using rubygems

 gem install sqweeze

=== Configuration

When run for the first time, the script creates a config file in the user's $HOME directory and sets therein the default paths of command line tools such as pngcrush and friends. 
 
 # file $HOME/.sqweeze.yml

 bin_paths:
    - pngcrush: /usr/bin/pngcrush
    - jpegtran: /usr/bin/jpegtran
    - gifsicle: /usr/bin/gifsicle
 
If you have installed these anywhere else than in /usr/bin+, you will have to edit this file so that sqweeze can find them.
